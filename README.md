## 📝Instructions

Your Job is to update the `src/models.py` file with the code needed to replicate the instagram data model.

The project is using the SQLAlchemy Python library to generate the database.

- What tables do you think instagram might have on its database: E.g: Post, User, etc.?
- What properties should go inside the user? or inside the Post table?
- Please add at least 4 models with all of its properties.
- Degenerate the diagram.png file at the end by running `$ python3 models.py` on the console.

This is my outcome.
